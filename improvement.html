      <p>Our analytics are created with respect to a <b>customized metric</b>. Our custom student-performance metric is
        a
        combination of standardized test scores in both reading and math and high school graduation rate, with a
        weighted distribution of 30%, 30%, and 40% respectively. OptiFind then plots this over a period spanning from
        2015 to the most recent data. OptiFind's custom student performance metric is a <b>revolution in measuring a
          school
          district's performance</b> as it removes any biases associated with favor to standarized testing or graduation
        rate.
        The distribution of our performance across the nation is always displayed by OptiFind in order to allow for easy
        contrast to be made when looking at specific school districts. <br> <br>

        Along with our performance metric, OptiFind makes it clear to understand the <b>demographics of a given school
          district</b>. Not only is the population aged 5-17 of a given district visible, the population that is in
        poverty is
        also represented. This information is also plotted in respect to time to <b>understand socioeconomic changes</b>
        whether
        good or bad to be clearly identifiable aiding in future planning.

        OptiFind's flagship feature is the predictive analytics. Wether looking at the nation or a specific school
        district, OptiFind will display the current district expenditure distribution and <b><u>computationally
            determine
            the
            optimial expenditure distribution </u></b>across the following categories: </p>
